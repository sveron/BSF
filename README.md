Black Soldier Fly (BSF) farming provides a sustainable approach to waste management and protein production. However, optimizing larval growth and nutrient content remains a challenge due to biological variability, environmental fluctuations, and economic constraints. This study presents an AI-driven Decision Support System (DSS) that leverages machine learning to assist farmers in formulating optimal diet compositions for BSF larvae.

Unlike many AI applications in agriculture, our system is developed using real-world experimental data with repeated measurements, enhancing robustness to biological variability. Recognizing the gap between data science and agricultural practice, we engaged farmers throughout the development process, integrating their domain knowledge into model refinement and decision-making.

To promote adoption, the system includes transparent visualizations and interactive tools, enabling farmers to interpret predictions and validate them through field testing. Our methodological approach accounts for repeated measurements in train-test splits, mitigating overfitting and improving generalizability. We further compare personalized ensemble model to a generalized model trained on multiple datasets, providing insights into the scalability of AI-based decision support in sustainable agriculture.
