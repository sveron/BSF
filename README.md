Code for the paper "Sustainable Black Soldier Fly Farming: A Recommender System for Diet Optimization".

This paper presents a practical approach to addressing environmental challenges by leveraging the potential of Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae in collaboration with Israeli agricultural startups, forming part of the BSF Consortium. BSF larvae, known for their high protein content, offer innovative solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, replacing fishmeal in animal feed to protect ocean ecosystems, and processing organic waste into valuable soil amendments. However, the quality and quantity of larvae production vary significantly depending on the nutritional value and composition of the diet, which is typically derived from organic waste mixtures. 

Our research focuses on designing and developing a recommender system to help farmers optimize diet composition based on desired larvae outcomes and available organic waste streams. To achieve this, our research team played a pivotal role in the Consortium by studying operational workflows, consulting with experts, and identifying key features for the predictive models. A comprehensive database of nutritional values was constructed to facilitate experimentation with various diets, generating critical data for model development. This collaborative effort resulted in a robust data set supporting our regression-based recommender models. Through extensive data analysis and expert consultations, we provided strategic recommendations to optimize BSF farming processes. The models were subsequently deployed to improve practical applications in the field.
